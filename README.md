The facial recognition is a very useful tool incorporated in many modern devices to detect human faces for tracking, biometric and to recognize human activities. In this project, I have used the OpenCV's Harr cascade classifiers for detecting human faces and pan/tilt servo mechanism to track the user's face using Arduino UNO.
